# Repository Workflows

This folder contains repository-wide workflows for CI/CD, testing, deployment, and other automation tasks.

## Workflows
- `release.yml`: Release automation including version bumping, Docker builds, and PyPI publishing.
- `auto-assign-issue.yml`: Automatically assigns issues to maintainers when opened.
- `auto-create-branch.yml`: Automatically creates development branches when issues are opened.

See the main [workflows README](../README.md) for overall structure and guidance.
