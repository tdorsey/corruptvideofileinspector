# CI Workflows

This folder contains continuous integration (CI) workflows for the repository. These workflows automate code quality checks, testing, Docker builds, and security scans on every push and pull request.

## Workflows
- `ci.yml`: Main CI/CD pipeline for linting, formatting, testing, Docker builds, and security scanning.
- `pr-title-check.yml`: Pull request validation including semantic title checking and issue reference validation.

See the main [workflows README](../README.md) for overall structure and guidance.
