# Ralph Progress Log

This file tracks the progress of Ralph iterations. Ralph will update this file after each iteration to record completed work items and iteration status.

## Format
Each iteration entry will include:
- Iteration number
- Timestamp
- Work item completed
- Status (success/failure)
- Any relevant notes

---

## Iteration 1 - 2026-01-16

**Work Item**: Ralph Progress Tracking Dashboard

**Status**: Revised - Implementation approach changed

**Notes**: 
- Initial approach created separate status command
- Revised to simpler model: Ralph tracks progress in this file (progress.txt)
- Work items stay in prd.json until completed
- Copilot processes items interactively following:
  1. Read PRD and progress file
  2. Pick highest-priority incomplete item
  3. Implement the feature
  4. Verify with tests
  5. Update progress.txt
  6. Commit changes
  7. Repeat

**Next**: Continue with prd.json work items using this workflow

## Iteration 2 - 2026-01-19

**Work Item**: REQ-1.1 - Update Scanner to Return Detailed Results

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

**Branch**: task/req-1.1-scanner-detailed-results → feature/complete-sqlite-integration

**Commit**: 817dd4d

**Changes**:
- Modified `VideoScanner.scan_directory()` to return `tuple[ScanSummary, list[ScanResult]]`
- Replaced direct FFmpeg subprocess calls with FFmpegClient methods
- Track individual ScanResult objects for each scanned file during scan
- Updated all callers: handlers.py, api/main.py, __init__.py
- Updated _store_scan_results to accept individual results parameter
- Removed unused subprocess import

**Impact**:
- Foundation established for database storage of individual scan results
- Better code organization using FFmpegClient abstraction
- API can now return detailed per-file scan results
- -126 lines, +53 lines (net: -73 lines)

**Tests**: Not yet written (database integration tests pending)

**Next Work Item**: REQ-1 - Complete Scan-to-Database Integration (CRITICAL priority)
