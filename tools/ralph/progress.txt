# Ralph Progress Log

This file tracks the progress of Ralph iterations. Ralph will update this file after each iteration to record completed work items and iteration status.

## Format
Each iteration entry will include:
- Iteration number
- Timestamp
- Work item completed
- Status (success/failure)
- Any relevant notes

---

## Iteration 1 - 2026-01-16

**Work Item**: Ralph Progress Tracking Dashboard

**Status**: Revised - Implementation approach changed

**Notes**: 
- Initial approach created separate status command
- Revised to simpler model: Ralph tracks progress in this file (progress.txt)
- Work items stay in prd.json until completed
- Copilot processes items interactively following:
  1. Read PRD and progress file
  2. Pick highest-priority incomplete item
  3. Implement the feature
  4. Verify with tests
  5. Update progress.txt
  6. Commit changes
  7. Repeat

**Next**: Continue with prd.json work items using this workflow
