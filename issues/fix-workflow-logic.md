## Issue
The current workflow logic that checks for issue references in pull request (PR) titles or bodies is flawed. As observed in PR #175, the workflow fails PRs even when the issue reference is present in the body.

## Proposed Fix
Update the workflow logic to correctly detect issue references (e.g., #123) in both the PR title and body. This will help avoid false negatives and ensure that PRs are evaluated accurately.

## Implementation Steps
1. Review the current workflow code responsible for checking issue references.
2. Modify the code to include checks for issue references in both the title and body of the PR.
3. Test the updated workflow with various PR scenarios to ensure it functions correctly.
4. Document any changes made to the workflow logic.

## Additional Notes
This fix is essential to improve the reliability of the workflow and ensure that contributions are not falsely rejected.
