# Search for shows
shows = Trakt['search'].shows('query')
```

### 4.3 Add to Watchlist (Priority: High)
**User Story**: As a user, I want to add movies and TV shows to my watchlist so I can track content I want to watch.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Add individual movies to watchlist
- Add entire TV shows to watchlist
- Add specific seasons or episodes to watchlist
- Batch add multiple items
- Confirmation messages for successful additions
- Duplicate detection and handling

**API Methods**:
```python
# Add movie to watchlist
Trakt['sync/watchlist'].add({
    'movies': [{'ids': {'trakt': movie_id}}]
})

# Add show to watchlist  
Trakt['sync/watchlist'].add({
    'shows': [{'ids': {'trakt': show_id}}]
})
```

### 4.4 Remove from Watchlist (Priority: High)
**User Story**: As a user, I want to remove items from my watchlist when I no longer want to watch them.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Remove individual movies from watchlist
- Remove TV shows from watchlist
- Remove specific seasons or episodes
- Batch remove multiple items
- Confirmation prompts for removal actions
- Undo functionality for accidental removals

**API Methods**:
```python
# Remove movie from watchlist
Trakt['sync/watchlist'].remove({
    'movies': [{'ids': {'trakt': movie_id}}]
})

# Remove show from watchlist
Trakt['sync/watchlist'].remove({
    'shows': [{'ids': {'trakt': show_id}}]
})
```

### 4.5 View Watchlist (Priority: Medium)
**User Story**: As a user, I want to view my current watchlist so I can see what content I plan to watch.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Display all watchlist items with metadata
- Sort by date added, title, year, or rating
- Filter by content type (movies vs shows)
- Show progress for partially watched series
- Export watchlist functionality

**API Methods**:
```python
# Get user's watchlist
watchlist = Trakt['sync/watchlist'].movies()
watchlist_shows = Trakt['sync/watchlist'].shows()
```

### 4.6 Bulk Operations (Priority: Medium)
**User Story**: As a user, I want to perform bulk operations so I can efficiently manage large numbers of items.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Select multiple items for batch operations
- Bulk add from search results or lists
- Bulk remove with confirmation
- Import watchlist from external sources
- Progress indicators for bulk operations
